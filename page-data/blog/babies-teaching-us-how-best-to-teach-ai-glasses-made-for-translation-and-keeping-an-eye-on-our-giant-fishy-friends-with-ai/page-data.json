Plus, machine learning is helping us prepare and respond to natural disasters and an app is now available to help content creators reach their target market, with the click of a button.</p><h2>1. The Ultimate Learning Machines</h2><p><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/site-assets-prod/blog_assets/the-weekly-roundup-15-Oct-2019-baby.jpg\" alt=\"The best learners in the universe come in a cute and tiny package\"></p><p>They may appear to have no clue about the world around them, but “<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-ultimate-learning-machines-11570806023\">human babies are the best learners in the universe. How do they do it? And could we get AI to do the same?</a>” That is the question that professor of psychology, Alison Gopnik is pondering as she and a team of computer scientists look at understanding how babies learn; and how they can teach AI to learn the same way.<br>Teaching AIs how to process data and learn from that is one thing, giving them the ability to adapt and learn in a messier and more complex way is another.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-ultimate-learning-machines-11570806023\">Read more here</a></p><h2>2. Why Machine Learning Is Critical for Disaster Response</h2><p>As unfortunate as it is, natural disasters are a common occurence and arguably taking place more often as the years go by. So, what can we do about it? While that answer is better suited for another time and place (and possibly a whole thesis written on the subject), we can look at how to manage ourselves and our surrounds when these disasters take place.<br>Machine learning is now being used to help better forecast when natural disasters may take place and how we can be better prepared for them.</p><p><a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/why-machine-learning-is-critical-for-disaster-response/\">Read more here</a></p><h2>3.

An app for content creators looking to connect with the right audience</h2><p>Many of us know the struggle of creating content online, wanting to share it with the world and realising we’re not reaching the audience we’d hoped to. Enter Joynt, an app developed to allow content creators to interact and share with their target audience.<br>Joynt allows you to create closed and secure groups with fans and followers, which in turn gives your followers exclusive access to your projects. There is the option to monetise content, meaning that as a content creator, you’re not only reaching your target audience but making money from it too.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/joynt-an-app-for-online-content-creators-is-a-place-safe-from-plagiarism/article29634727.ece\">Read more here</a></p><h2>5.

It can also differentiate between sharks of the same species, meaning Bruce won’t get counted twice.</p><p>An app is available for life guards so they know how many (if any) sharks are lurking about at any given time of day.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/artifical-intelligence-shark-tracking-3e84de14-3da3-4520-866d-a8beb8eb2e1e.html\">Read more here</a></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Please connect with us on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/videotranslator/\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGrwmRcZiFkyq8-xAwn77Yg/\">YouTube</a> or <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/videotranslatorai/\">Facebook</a> for any comments, questions, or just to keep up to date with the work we do!</p><p>We are very grateful for your support!</p><p>If you haven’t yet and are interested in trying out our technology, please <a href=\"https://videotranslator.ai/free-trial\">try our platform</a>, or drop us an email at <a href=\"mailto:hello@videotranslator.ai\">hello@videotranslator.ai</a>.</p>"}},"postedDate":"Oct 13, 2019"},"relatedBlogPost":{"nodes":[{"id":"75ac7f6a-106e-5fcb-bcbc-a40098231cb5","title":"VideoTranslator Is Retiring Our Existing App","slug":"videotranslator-is-retiring-our-existing-app","description":"We are in the process of reaching out to all our subscribers to tell them about our current platform being retired","cover":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#786868","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/0914fcdbb283f61246894d5de227be39/669f3/videotranslator_is_retiring_our_existing_app_banner_650a022650.jpg","srcSet":"/static/0914fcdbb283f61246894d5de227be39/53b2b/videotranslator_is_retiring_our_existing_app_banner_650a022650.jpg 256w,\n/static/0914fcdbb283f61246894d5de227be39/d4d2a/videotranslator_is_retiring_our_existing_app_banner_650a022650.jpg 512w,\n/static/0914fcdbb283f61246894d5de227be39/669f3/videotranslator_is_retiring_our_existing_app_banner_650a022650.jpg 1024w","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/0914fcdbb283f61246894d5de227be39/36766/videotranslator_is_retiring_our_existing_app_banner_650a022650.webp 256w,\n/static/0914fcdbb283f61246894d5de227be39/a79fe/videotranslator_is_retiring_our_existing_app_banner_650a022650.webp 512w,\n/static/0914fcdbb283f61246894d5de227be39/2d898/videotranslator_is_retiring_our_existing_app_banner_650a022650.webp 1024w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"}]},"width":1024,"height":768}}}},"coverAlt":"VideoTranslator Is Retiring Our Existing App","postedDate":"Mar 16, 2022","blogCategories":[{"categoryName":"Engineering"}]},{"id":"2a98f47b-cf2c-556d-883e-678e696c1eb6","title":"What Team VT Is Planning In 2022!","slug":"what-team-vt-is-planning-in-2022","description":"Happy New Year 2022, the feeling around the office is that a pretty messy 2021 is done, and we are looking forward optimistically to 2022.
