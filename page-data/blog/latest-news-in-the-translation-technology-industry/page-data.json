Woolaroo helps to promote endangered languages by using interactive and educational tools.</p><p>Woolaroo uses a person’s phone camera to discover an object and translate it into its native word with pronunciation. Since it is an open-source application, anyone can contribute to the Woolaroo library.</p><p>The platform is currently available in 10 different languages, including Yugambeh which is an aboriginal language from South Queensland with only one surviving speaker, and Nawat which has less than 500 speakers. The application is available in English, Spanish, Arabic, French, Italian.</p><h2>2. Real-Time Phone Call Translator</h2><p>You would have heard of video translation, live transcription, and live translation, but have you heard about real-time phone call translator? iTourTranslator has made real-time phone translation possible. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyj9cQA3nQ0\">Here’s how it works.</a></p><p><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/itourtranslator_e4cde73417.jpg\" alt=\"itourtranslator.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_itourtranslator_e4cde73417.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_itourtranslator_e4cde73417.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_itourtranslator_e4cde73417.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_itourtranslator_e4cde73417.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"></p><p>First, you would need to send a link to the phone call receiver. The call can be made from various social platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Line, Telegram, or WeChat. The call translated call can be made when the receiver clicks on the link. The receiver does not need to download nor register to the app.</p><p>Let’s say the caller speaks English and the receiver speaks Indonesian. When the caller speaks, the receiver will get the message translated into Indonesian, and when the receiver replies in Indonesian the caller will get it translated into English.</p><p>iTourTranslator currently supports these languages: <strong>English, Spanish, German, French, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Arabic, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Portuguese, Catalan, and Thai.</strong></p><h2>3.

Hendriks III, U.S. Spokesman for Jehovah’s Witnesses.</i></p></blockquote><p>The ASL Bible was originally designed to be put on DVDs. However, as technology advances, the project is made into videos that are available on a smartphone app.</p><p>Hopefully, this innovation can be a beginning of a breakthrough for the deaf and hard of hearing communities around the world.</p><h2>4. Cambodian Students Created A STEM Translation Application</h2><p>Ratantepy Narin, a Cambodian high school student, loves to find learning resources on the internet. The biggest problem she encountered was most of the materials were in English. To solve this problem, she and three of her classmates with the help of a local freelance consultant Cassandra Mok decided to build an app.</p><p>Narin, Leakena Chea, Vuthnyneath Tep, and Chherika Chheal under the name of Teen4tech created the app after participating in the Technovation Girls competition program.</p><p><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/teen4tech_b5fb121c48.jpg\" alt=\"teen4tech.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_teen4tech_b5fb121c48.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_teen4tech_b5fb121c48.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_teen4tech_b5fb121c48.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_teen4tech_b5fb121c48.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"></p><p>Four months later, <a href=\"https://www.khmertimeskh.com/50854660/students-global-ambitions-for-stem-translation-application/\">ScholarED is released.</a> ScholarEd is an app that translates the complex terminology of the STEM subjects from English to Khmer.</p><blockquote><p><i>“We’re hoping that everyone can learn anything online. We don’t want a language barrier to limit anyone’s knowledge or their potential online education,” said Narin.</i></p></blockquote><p>The Teen4Tech team has received positive feedback. Hopefully, the app can help Cambodians grow their potential in the STEM industry.</p><p>The Video Translator team is very happy to know that there are more people who are interested in translation technology.
