Recognizing the potential of this funding opportunity, we enthusiastically embarked on the application process, eager to make a difference.</p><h2>The Competitive Application</h2><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://youtu.be/j1ldMkzZFXA\"><div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j1ldMkzZFXA\" style=\"position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0;\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><p>Our team invested significant time, effort, and expertise in crafting a compelling application. We meticulously outlined our innovative solution, which aimed to enhance bushfire detection and response mechanisms, mitigate risks, and protect communities in vulnerable areas.</p><p>We presented a comprehensive business plan, showcasing the viability and long-term sustainability of our project. Our application truly reflected our passion and commitment to addressing the challenges posed by bushfires.</p><h2>The Power of Positive Feedback</h2><p>Although we did not secure the grant, the feedback we received from the Bushfire Commercialisation Fund was highly encouraging.</p><p>It highlighted the strengths of our application, acknowledging the depth of our research, the robustness of our proposed solution, and the potential impact it could have in mitigating bushfire risks.</p><p>Such positive feedback reaffirmed our belief in the value and relevance of our project, providing a much-needed boost to our team's morale.</p><p>Also, we'd like to give a big shout out to the <a href=\"https://www.chiefscientist.nsw.gov.au/rdnsw/bushfire-response-rd-mission\">Bushfire Response R&amp;D Mission at Office of the Chief Scientist &amp; Engineer</a>. The managers there were really helpful and took the time to jump on a videoconference and walk us through the committee feedback.</p><p>For anyone reading this, always ask for feedback!&nbsp;</p><h2>Lessons Learned and Moving Forward</h2><p>In every setback lies an opportunity for growth. Our experience with the Bushfire Commercialisation Fund taught us valuable lessons that will shape our future endeavours. Firstly, it reinforced the importance of resilience in the face of adversity. We recognized that setbacks are an inherent part of the innovation process and should not deter us from pursuing our goals.</p><p>Secondly, the feedback we received served as a valuable roadmap for further refinement and improvement. We carefully analysed the suggestions provided and identified areas where we could enhance our application, strengthen our project's impact, and align more closely with the grant's objectives.&nbsp;</p><p>The point is not necessarily that the feedback is a reflection of our strengths and weaknesses. It may be that, but in our case, we found it to be a mix of gaps in our capability, and gaps in the submission where we did not demonstrate our capabilities in the best way possible.&nbsp;</p><p>This feedback will undoubtedly contribute to our ongoing efforts to secure alternative sources of funding and partnerships.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Our journey with the Bushfire Commercialisation Fund may not have resulted in a successful grant, but it was a significant milestone in our pursuit of making a positive impact.</p><p>The feedback received has further fuelled our determination to refine our project, seek additional funding avenues, and continue working towards enhancing bushfire detection and response capabilities.</p><p>Through resilience, collaboration, and a relentless pursuit of our vision, we are confident that we can contribute to the ongoing efforts in bushfire recovery and mitigation.</p><p>We very much still think our product has much to offer the resilience community and are committed to making it work!</p>"}},"postedDate":"Jan 30, 2023"},"relatedBlogPost":{"nodes":[{"id":"6e1f887d-b3da-5bb3-9a2b-d5dd54134997","title":"VideoTranslatorAI at the 2024 NSW Commercialisation Showcase","slug":"videotranslatorai-at-the-2024-nsw-commercialisation-showcase","description":"Join VideoTranslatorAI as we showcase cutting-edge tech at the 2024 NSW Commercialisation Showcase, celebrating innovation and collaboration in NSW!","cover":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#383828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/2a97a192100931aee68db925ca6c1f90/669f3/Video_Translator_AI_at_the_2024_NSW_Commercialisation_Showcase_a8dadcf777.jpg","srcSet":"/static/2a97a192100931aee68db925ca6c1f90/53b2b/Video_Translator_AI_at_the_2024_NSW_Commercialisation_Showcase_a8dadcf777.jpg 256w,\n/static/2a97a192100931aee68db925ca6c1f90/d4d2a/Video_Translator_AI_at_the_2024_NSW_Commercialisation_Showcase_a8dadcf777.jpg 512w,\n/static/2a97a192100931aee68db925ca6c1f90/669f3/Video_Translator_AI_at_the_2024_NSW_Commercialisation_Showcase_a8dadcf777.jpg 1024w","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/2a97a192100931aee68db925ca6c1f90/36766/Video_Translator_AI_at_the_2024_NSW_Commercialisation_Showcase_a8dadcf777.webp 256w,\n/static/2a97a192100931aee68db925ca6c1f90/a79fe/Video_Translator_AI_at_the_2024_NSW_Commercialisation_Showcase_a8dadcf777.webp 512w,\n/static/2a97a192100931aee68db925ca6c1f90/2d898/Video_Translator_AI_at_the_2024_NSW_Commercialisation_Showcase_a8dadcf777.webp 1024w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"}]},"width":1024,"height":768}}}},"coverAlt":"VideoTranslatorAI at the 2024 NSW Commercialisation Showcase","postedDate":"Apr 21, 2024","blogCategories":[{"categoryName":"Enterprise"},{"categoryName":"Healthcare"},{"categoryName":"Safety"}]},{"id":"ae5dcc7f-64d6-54bd-bb27-c6ff8043b421","title":"Our Trusted Lingo Poster Was Accepted At AFAC '23!","slug":"our-trusted-lingo-poster-was-accepted-at-afac-23","description":"Our poster on Project Trusted Lingo was accepted at the AFAC Conference.
