We are retiring our existing VideoTranslator SaaS (Software as a Service) application. In this blog post we talk about why the app is being retired, ongoing support provision during/after retirement and what will replace the current value proposition.</p><h2>Are We Done?</h2><p>Absolutely not. Our VideoTranslator app lived a good life, but this post is about celebrating our efforts, what we learned, and where we are going.</p><p><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/lifecycle_videotranslator_v1_1_bb1f0c01ea.jpg\" alt=\"lifecycle-videotranslator-v1-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_lifecycle_videotranslator_v1_1_bb1f0c01ea.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_lifecycle_videotranslator_v1_1_bb1f0c01ea.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_lifecycle_videotranslator_v1_1_bb1f0c01ea.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_lifecycle_videotranslator_v1_1_bb1f0c01ea.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\">We started the company, QBL Media, all the way back in 2014. However, work only started in 2017. The app which would become the current VideoTranslator App was started in 2018.</p><p>By 2019, we soft-launched the app. Over the next 3 years, our VideoTranslator app got over 10,000 signed-up users, and hundreds of hours of video content transcribed, translated and dubbed - note, including both our efforts and clients who used the app.</p><p>Internally, we went from a single founder and outsourced developer in India to a 5 man team across Australia and India. We went from being a single room in a client’s office to having our own little 4 desk setup. And it’s likely we will be expanding over the next few months too.</p><p>So lots have happened. But the big news is… the next iteration of our retail offering is currently expected to go live in June 2022!</p><h2>What Did We Get Right About Video Transcription, Video Translation and Video Dubbing?</h2><p>We got a few big things right about version 1 of the VideoTranslator App. Specifically:</p><ul><li>There is significant demand at the content creator level for video transcription, translation and dubbing in a single platform.</li><li>While LSPs tend to focus on big enterprise clients - who pay the bills so this makes sense - there is a substantial number of users at the bottom who have not been provided with a solid solution.</li><li>Marketers like the idea of translating their content. Unfortunately, unless the client is Japanese, German or Korean (think big exporter-type companies), this is more of an aspiration versus a need.</li><li>The core flow is much harder than anyone thinks, for a number of different reasons.</li></ul><p>Practically, this means that while lots of people tried and made use of our product, the product itself was not solid enough to convert this to recurring revenue. As a practical matter, more people used the one-off payment model than the subscription payment model.</p><h2>What Did We Get Wrong About AI Usage in Transcription, Translation And Dubbing?</h2><p>Plenty. The core issue is that AI is not good enough to make this process as seamless as possible.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/can_ai_be_frustrating_4b8f2f1228.jpg\" alt=\"can-ai-be-frustrating.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_can_ai_be_frustrating_4b8f2f1228.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_can_ai_be_frustrating_4b8f2f1228.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_can_ai_be_frustrating_4b8f2f1228.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_can_ai_be_frustrating_4b8f2f1228.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"><figcaption>Can AI be frustrating?</figcaption></figure><p>AI has a lot of promise, and we at VideoTranslator think there is a lot we can do with it. Unfortunately, the existing VideoTranslator app was essentially an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) in many respects.</p><p>Structurally, there were a number of engineering decisions made which meant that upgrading the existing app is very hard.</p><p>Additionally, innovations where we can now give you <strong>ways to train your own AI</strong> mean that it was basically impossible to upgrade what we had, and a new app was required.</p><h2>What Do I Need To Know About The Retirement?</h2><p>Not a lot.</p><p>We are in the process of reaching out to all our subscribers to tell them about our current platform being retired. The process looks like this -</p><ul><li>March 2022 - Retirement announcement, outreach to the existing client base.</li><li>April 2022 - Final outreach to legacy users, including grandfathering existing clients’ pricing model to the new app.</li><li><strong>May 2022 - Turn off existing application.</strong></li></ul><p>If you are an existing subscriber, or have files on our system, and have <strong>not yet</strong> been contacted by our support team, please reach out [hello@videotranslator.ai](mailto: <a href=\"mailto:hello@videotranslator.ai\">hello@videotranslator.ai</a> “<a href=\"mailto:hello@videotranslator.ai\">hello@videotranslator.ai</a>”).</p><h2>What Do I Get In The New Version?</h2><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/what_improvements_are_coming_in_videotranslator_2_69e3d7b389.jpg\" alt=\"what-improvements-are-coming-in-videotranslator-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_what_improvements_are_coming_in_videotranslator_2_69e3d7b389.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_what_improvements_are_coming_in_videotranslator_2_69e3d7b389.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_what_improvements_are_coming_in_videotranslator_2_69e3d7b389.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_what_improvements_are_coming_in_videotranslator_2_69e3d7b389.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"></figure><p>We will have a number of blog posts coming out as we get closer to the new app. The big stand-out feature is custom glossaries/libraries which can be set up to automatically learn on the fly.</p><p>Basically, you will be able to train your own AI.</p><p>If you are keen to understand/work with the new version early, please contact us at [hello@videotranslator.ai](mailto: <a href=\"mailto:hello@videotranslator.ai\">hello@videotranslator.ai</a> “<a href=\"mailto:hello@videotranslator.ai\">hello@videotranslator.ai</a>”).</p><h2>Outro</h2><p>While the existing app is still good in many respects, we are stopping support and will be taking it down over the next month with a hard shutdown in early May.</p><p>If you have specific requirements and need some of the more complex workflows, please contact us [hello@videotranslator.ai](mailto: <a href=\"mailto:hello@videotranslator.ai\">hello@videotranslator.ai</a> “<a href=\"mailto:hello@videotranslator.ai\">hello@videotranslator.ai</a>”) - and our support team will be able to assist you.</p><p>We’d also like to thank all the people who tried the app, used the app, paid used the app and generally all the feedback and well-wishers who we had the privilege to work with - you were all fantastic and we have received so much love and good wishes… its a bit overwhelming, to be honest!</p><p>Thank you so much for your support again, and here are some images we really liked!</p><p>Thank You All So Much!</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/img_20220114_102249_420512cdd1.jpg\" alt=\"img_20220114_102249.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_img_20220114_102249_420512cdd1.jpg 117w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_img_20220114_102249_420512cdd1.jpg 375w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_img_20220114_102249_420512cdd1.jpg 563w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_img_20220114_102249_420512cdd1.jpg 750w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"750px\"><figcaption>We need a new logo!</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"}},"postedDate":"Mar 16, 2022"},"relatedBlogPost":{"nodes":[{"id":"2a98f47b-cf2c-556d-883e-678e696c1eb6","title":"What Team VT Is Planning In 2022!","slug":"what-team-vt-is-planning-in-2022","description":"Happy New Year 2022, the feeling around the office is that a pretty messy 2021 is done, and we are looking forward optimistically to 2022.
