Like, really really hard. In many ways, the journey of VideoTranslator has been around how to find product-market fit.</p><p>So why listen to us about product-market fit? Frankly, after working on it ourselves for several years, and helping many of our clients get to the same place, we know a few things about it.</p><h2>Why Are We Talking About Pre-Product Marketing?</h2><p>This started over beers with one of our clients. VideoTranslator serves many clients, but a large proportion (75%) of our clients are startups. Why are so many of our clients startups?</p><p>See, the reality is the only thing a startup needs to do is… well, survive. Seriously. If you are a startup without product-market fit, i.e. you are a startup, the only thing you really really need to do is survive.</p><p>One of our clients made the point that the most useful service we provided was advice on pre-product market fit marketing.</p><p><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/6k84a7_8a1fa1901b.jpg\" alt=\"6k84a7.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_6k84a7_8a1fa1901b.jpg 156w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"156px\"></p><p>This was a bit of a revelation. You would be forgiven for thinking this is not the case, seeing as we are trying to be an AI firm that provides a specific service, but hey… who knew?</p><p>It’s a bit more complicated, seeing as our service is primarily to small-sized exporters, but at the core of it, we were helping our clients to survive.</p><p>Those beers were very insightful…</p><h2>How We Got To Helping Our Clients Find Product Market Fit?</h2><p>VideoTranslator’s primary product is AI-powered video translation services. That is, practically speaking, the following happens…</p><p><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/how_video_translation_works_transcribe_translate_voice_244d370e93.jpg\" alt=\"how-video-translation-works-transcribe-translate-voice.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_how_video_translation_works_transcribe_translate_voice_244d370e93.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_how_video_translation_works_transcribe_translate_voice_244d370e93.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_how_video_translation_works_transcribe_translate_voice_244d370e93.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_how_video_translation_works_transcribe_translate_voice_244d370e93.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"></p><p>Right, so it’s not that complex. First, you upload a video, and then transcribe, translate and optionally add a voice-over. It can be more complex, with all the options around the AI’s, but that is not so important for the purposes of this discussion.</p><p>But why would you do this?</p><p>Consider a video asset on YouTube. The reality is that search engines are based on text, so to make videos easily searchable we use things like the title, description, and captions.</p><p>When you have the captions in multiple languages, with or without the voiceover, it makes the asset searchable by users in different languages.</p><p>That it. It’s basically video SEO optimization across multiple languages, which allows clients who don’t speak English to find your product.</p><p>Startups are generally desperately looking for someone, anyone, who will buy their product.</p><p>Why? Because this way they survive.</p><p>This way YOU survive.</p><h2>How We Can Help You With Pre-Product Market Fit Marketing?</h2><p>Several ways. And stay tuned for more on this.</p><p>We will help you find a market for a product that either, (a) does not exist yet, (b) is a work in progress, or © needs funding and traction.</p><h3>Product Market Fit For A Non-Existent Product</h3><p>The client work we do here is mostly for clients who are in deep tech. You have an idea or minimum viable product (MVP) which has a mix of hardware and software components.</p><p>These products are hard to sell, and sales are generally to enterprise or government clients in the early stage.</p><p>Finding early clients, finding linkages with universities, and finding grants that mix industry, academia and government as collaborative efforts. This is our bread and butter.</p><h3>Product Market Fit For A Work In Progress</h3><p>You have a few clients but are not really making money.</p><p>How do you build credibility, get interesting and inspiring collaborators, and then pitch it to a big enterprise or government agency client?</p><p>We can help. Why trust us? We’ve actually done this ourselves.</p><p>Our old app, VideoTranslator 1.0 picked up over 9000+ users (retail) and several enterprise clients.</p><p>Our new app, VideoTranslator 2.0 is being rebuilt explicitly to cater to this market.</p><p>Why? Again, this is what we know how to do.</p><h3>Product Market Fit To Raise Funding And Get Traction</h3><p>You have some semblance of a product. But you need to raise funding, and ideally, a client who can give you stability. How do you do this?</p><p>Alternatively, you have some traction, but not a whole heap. Where do you find additional clients to hit the growth numbers you need - we can help with that.</p><p>We have significant expertise in finding odd and uninteresting niches. Why would you want that? So YOU survive.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>I get it. You need to go from Zero To One. You are a fan of Peter Thiel. I hear you. But it is not working…</p><p>The point is not to go from zero to one. It’s to get from zero to point one, and then point two, and then point three.</p><p>That is the kind of service we can provide to your company. Or more realistically, to your vision for the service, you can provide.</p><p>Oh yeah - don’t spend money on ads. Pro-tip. Because we have done that too and understand how useless pre-product market fit is.</p><p>Ping through an email to <a href=\"mailto:hello@videotranslator.ai\">hello@videotranslator.ai</a> if we can help you!</p>"}},"postedDate":"Jun 18, 2022"},"relatedBlogPost":{"nodes":[{"id":"5cbd44d7-c26d-5cfb-9f62-5cf159880f94","title":"Unveiling the TikTok Trends of 2024: From GRWM to AI Innovations","slug":"unveiling-the-tiktok-trends-of-2024-from-grwm-to-ai-innovations","description":"As 2024 wraps up, don't miss these top TikTok trends!
