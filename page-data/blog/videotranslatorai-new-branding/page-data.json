With these changes in mind, we think it is also time to do some transformations with our branding.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>We started the company, QBL Media, all the way back in 2014. However, work only started in 2017. The app which would become the current VideoTranslator App was started in 2018.</p><p>By 2019, we soft-launched the app. Over the next 3 years, our VideoTranslator app got over 10,000 signed-up users, and hundreds of hours of video content transcribed, translated and dubbed - note, including both our efforts and clients who used the app.</p><p>Internally, we went from a single founder and outsourced developer in India to a 5 man team across Australia and India. We went from being a single room in a client’s office to having our own little 4 desk setup.</p><p>Earlier this year, we started working on a new version of the app. This process made us realize that we did not have a clear brand guideline that defined our visual style and who we are as an AI company.</p><h2>Our Original Branding</h2><p>Originally, this is the logo that we used for our branding.</p><p><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2_12_99e657f1ae.jpg\" alt=\"2-12.jpg\"></p><p>It is a mixture of a human and a robot - in line with our vision that an AI is not there to replace humans but rather to make our jobs easier. The font we mainly use is Montserrat.</p><p>Other than that, there wasn’t really a standardise brand styling that we used.</p><h2>VideoTranslatorAI’s New Branding</h2><p>Around the second quarter of the year, we contacted a very talented designer, <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/jasminelyy\">Jasmine Lo</a>, to redesign our logo and other visual elements. With Jasmine’s help, we were able to redefine our brand identity.</p><h3>Our brand identity</h3><p><strong>Our mission:</strong> Using language to reach a wider audience.</p><p><strong>Our vision:</strong> Using AI to supercharge content marketing.</p><p><strong>Our tagline:</strong> Speak and be heard - We believe that it does not matter what language you speak. As long as you speak, your voice and message will be heard by many.</p><h3>VideoTranslatorAI’s new logo</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, our previous logo is a mixture of a human and a robot. After redefining our brand identity, we moved on to redesigning our old logo.</p><p>In total, Jasmine made around 11 sketches of our new logo. There were a couple that we really like, but we ended up choosing this one!</p><p><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/3_12_f38df70ccd.jpg\" alt=\"3-12.jpg\"></p><p>In relation to our brand identity, our logo has these meanings:</p><ol><li>It is a stylised rendition of our old logo, merged with sound waves instead.</li><li>Each person (users) is represented by the circle on the sound wave.</li><li>We aim to show that even though each soundwave is different, the integration of our AI translation will work hand in hand with the soundwaves and be seen by many.</li></ol><h3>Our brand style</h3><p>To make a more standardised brand styling, Jasmine also helped us create the following:</p><p><strong>Brand identity colours</strong></p><p><strong>Offwhite</strong> - general base colour</p><p><strong>Purple</strong> - inspires wisdom, promotes enlightenment, triggers creativity, sense of familiarity with the brand.</p><p><strong>Blue</strong> - inspires trust, suggests precision, and trustworthiness.</p><p><strong>Green</strong> - promotes growth, encouraging, a sense of familiarity with the brand.</p><p><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/4_9_56dbd70e39.jpg\" alt=\"4-9.jpg\"></p><p><strong>Identity typeface</strong></p><p>Previously, we used the font Montserrat for our branding. After Jasmine’s rendition, we are now using Poppins as our typeface.</p><p><strong>Brand graphics</strong></p><p>We hope to connect with people through a simple translation. The circles are meant to represent the people we aim to touch.</p><p><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/5_8_3ee07eaa63.jpg\" alt=\"5-8.jpg\"></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Massive shoutout to Jasmine for making all these happen!</p><p>What do you think of our new branding?</p><p>For more information about us, don’t hesitate to contact us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@videotranslator.ai\"><strong>hello@videotranslator.ai</strong></a>.</p>"}},"postedDate":"Nov 05, 2022"},"relatedBlogPost":{"nodes":[{"id":"452304a8-6345-5e6e-adf3-6ffa50de73e2","title":"Bridging Languages, Unleashing Global Potential: Introducing Our New Website and App","slug":"bridging-languages-unleashing-global-potential-introducing-our-new-website-and-app","description":"Discover our website and app, with native multilingual support and powerful transcription, translation, and voiceover capabilities in 120 languages.","cover":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#785848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b5de6e62f802179f42a0d09fb8900de7/669f3/A_New_Website_And_App_a8c97b49a7.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b5de6e62f802179f42a0d09fb8900de7/53b2b/A_New_Website_And_App_a8c97b49a7.jpg 256w,\n/static/b5de6e62f802179f42a0d09fb8900de7/d4d2a/A_New_Website_And_App_a8c97b49a7.jpg 512w,\n/static/b5de6e62f802179f42a0d09fb8900de7/669f3/A_New_Website_And_App_a8c97b49a7.jpg 1024w","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/b5de6e62f802179f42a0d09fb8900de7/36766/A_New_Website_And_App_a8c97b49a7.webp 256w,\n/static/b5de6e62f802179f42a0d09fb8900de7/a79fe/A_New_Website_And_App_a8c97b49a7.webp 512w,\n/static/b5de6e62f802179f42a0d09fb8900de7/2d898/A_New_Website_And_App_a8c97b49a7.webp 1024w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"}]},"width":1024,"height":768}}}},"coverAlt":"Bridging Languages, Unleashing Global Potential: Introducing Our New Website and App","postedDate":"Mar 07, 2023","blogCategories":[{"categoryName":"Video Translator"},{"categoryName":"Video Transcription"},{"categoryName":"Video Dubbing"},{"categoryName":"Welcome"},{"categoryName":"Video Translation"},{"categoryName":"Support"},{"categoryName":"Education"},{"categoryName":"Safety"},{"categoryName":"Healthcare"}]},{"id":"2a98f47b-cf2c-556d-883e-678e696c1eb6","title":"What Team VT Is Planning In 2022!","slug":"what-team-vt-is-planning-in-2022","description":"Happy New Year 2022, the feeling around the office is that a pretty messy 2021 is done, and we are looking forward optimistically to 2022.
