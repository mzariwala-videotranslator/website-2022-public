It began with the “heartless” Tin man from the Wizard of Oz and continued with the humanoid robot that impersonated Maria in Metropolis.</p><p><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2_a08a83e5fd.jpg\" alt=\"2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_2_a08a83e5fd.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_2_a08a83e5fd.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_2_a08a83e5fd.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_2_a08a83e5fd.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"></p><p>In the 1950s, a young British polymath called Alan Turing wrote a paper about <a href=\"https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf\">Computing Machinery and Intelligence</a> where he discussed building intelligent machines and testing their intelligence.</p><p>It wasn’t until 1956 that the concept of artificial intelligence was initialized. The first artificial intelligence program was presented based on the concept of Logic Theorist by Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw, and Herbert Simon.</p><p>Since then, artificial intelligence flourished and went on a roller coaster journey of successes and setbacks.</p><h2>Why Is AI-Powered Translator Important?</h2><h3><strong>AI Technology Is Creating New Jobs</strong></h3><p>Many people think that technology is taking away jobs. <a href=\"http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018.pdf\">The World Economic Forum</a> estimated that automation may cause a loss of 75 million jobs. However, it also noted that 133 million new jobs will emerge by 2022.</p><p>The truth is, technological innovations such as AI-powered translation software like us do not take away jobs. In fact, we are making new pools of jobs. AI-powered translators still need human touches to ensure that the software runs smoothly. In addition, updates both from the software and user interface sides are constantly needed. AI-based companies will need software engineers, designers, IT professionals, and many more.</p><h3><strong>AI-Powered Translation Helps You Reach A Wider Audience</strong></h3><p>English is the most spoken language in the world. The widespread use of the English language is heavily influenced by British colonialism. The United Kingdom imposed English on their territories around the world, hence making it the most spoken language worldwide with <a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/100-most-spoken-languages/\">1.35 billion speakers</a>.</p><p><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/3_6860a49c3b.jpg\" alt=\"3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_3_6860a49c3b.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_3_6860a49c3b.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_3_6860a49c3b.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_3_6860a49c3b.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"></p><p>Interestingly, out of the billion English speakers, only about 30% of them are native speakers. <a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/100-most-spoken-languages/\">About 30% of the world</a> speak Mandarin, Hindi, Spanish and French.</p><p>If you use an AI-powered translator, you can automatically translate documents and contents. Imagine if you translate your documents and contents to four other most spoken languages, you can now reach 30% more of the world population.</p><h3><strong>AI-Powered Translation Enhances Human Efforts</strong></h3><p>Time is valuable. We understand that AI-powered translators cannot beat human translators. The lack of human touch is what AI-powered translators are missing. Therefore, we are here to help these professionals.</p><p>With AI-powered translators, we can help professional translators to automatically transcribe their documents. This process is especially beneficial in translating videos. Before the existence of AI-powered translators, professionals need to manually type down the scripts and adjust the script time to match the video. All of these tasks can now be done by AI software.</p><p>In short, our software enhances the speed, precision and effectiveness of human efforts</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The world is changing. AI is already changing and affecting a big part of our everyday lives. You should use an AI-powered translator because it is creating new jobs, help you reach wider markets and enhance your human efforts.</p><p>If you want to use AI-powered translator but do not know where to start, we are here to help you. <i><strong>Do not hesitate to contact us at</strong></i> <a href=\"mailto:hello@videotranslator.ai\">hello@videotranslator.ai</a> .</p>"}},"postedDate":"Mar 07, 2021"},"relatedBlogPost":{"nodes":[{"id":"5cbd44d7-c26d-5cfb-9f62-5cf159880f94","title":"Unveiling the TikTok Trends of 2024: From GRWM to AI Innovations","slug":"unveiling-the-tiktok-trends-of-2024-from-grwm-to-ai-innovations","description":"As 2024 wraps up, don't miss these top TikTok trends!
