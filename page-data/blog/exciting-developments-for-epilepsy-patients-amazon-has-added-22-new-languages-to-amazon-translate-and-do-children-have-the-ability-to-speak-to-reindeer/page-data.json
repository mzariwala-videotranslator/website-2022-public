Well, if you’re in NSW, you’re about to become a lot more aware and mindful when you’re doing it. In a world-first that commenced December 1 2019, the NSW Centre for Road Safety are using AI mobile phone detection cameras to spot drivers who are illegally (read: not using their phones handsfree) when driving. <a href=\"https://roadsafety.transport.nsw.gov.au/stayingsafe/mobilephones/technology.html\">The system uses artificial intelligence to automatically review images and detect offending drivers, and to exclude images of non-offending drivers from further action. Images that the automated system considers likely to contain a driver illegally using a mobile phone are verified by authorised personnel.</a><br>For the first three months drivers will receive a warning letter. Once the three month period is up, drivers will receive five demerit points and fines of $344 or $457 if in a school zone.<br>In what is already a notoriously dangerous time of year on the roads, play it safe and stay off your phone when driving regardless of which state you’re in <i>please</i>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/ai-camera-system-launches-in-australia-to-catch-drivers-on-phones/\">Read more here</a></p><h2>4.
