Peterborough City Council Procures Translation Videos to Keep Communities Safe in Coronavirus Pandemic</h2><p>Both Peterborough City and Cambridgeshire County Councils in the UK have released videos in almost 30 languages (with more to come) to help everyone in the community understand that staying home means saving lives.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/people/peterborough-city-council-produces-translation-videos-keep-communities-safe-coronavirus-pandemic-2523756\">“‘Working with our diverse communities to make sure they understand the very important ‘stay at home’ message is a critical part of our work at the moment,’ said Superintendent Laura Hunt, ‘…our policing style is built on consent and having a positive relationship with the community… so the translation videos produced by the city and county council will prove very useful for police officers when they come across people who struggle to understand the messages in English.’”</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/people/peterborough-city-council-produces-translation-videos-keep-communities-safe-coronavirus-pandemic-2523756\">Read the full story here</a></p><h2>2.

The 21-year-old, along with her mother, is making face masks that allow the deaf and hard of hearing to still be able to use facial expressions when speaking ASL (American Sign Language). Being able to see and use facial expressions when communicating is extremely important in ASL and an extremely difficult thing to do if half of your face is covered due to a mask.</p><p>So, using her and her mum’s craftiness to good use, they have created masks with plastic windows that allow the users mouth to be seen.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.lex18.com/news/coronavirus/college-student-makes-masks-for-the-deaf-hard-of-hearing\">“'I felt like there was a huge population that was being looked over,” Lawrence said. ‘We’re all panicking right now and so a lot of people are just not being thought of. So, I felt like it was very important that, even at a time like this, people need to have that communication.’\"</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.lex18.com/news/coronavirus/college-student-makes-masks-for-the-deaf-hard-of-hearing\">Read the full story here</a></p><h2>3. How AI Can Determine Which Coronavirus Patients Require Hospitalisation</h2><p>A leading healthcare company in the US, Jvion is developing an AI project which is undertaking data to better understand how patients will or won’t react to treatment for COVID-19. The aim is to be able to determine which patients will need to be hospitalized and who can stay at home to safely recover. This will in turn could reduce the capacity of patients in hospitals and give the overworked nurses and doctors a little relief.</p><p><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/neural/2020/04/02/ai-can-help-manage-hospital-resources-during-the-coronavirus-crisis-syndication/\">“Jvion’s approach helps [to] determine individual risk levels while using minimal or no clinical data and using limited patient-level information that doesn’t require special medical equipment. This will make it possible to leverage the AI to study large populations and determine high-risk patients without flooding medical centers.”</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/neural/2020/04/02/ai-can-help-manage-hospital-resources-during-the-coronavirus-crisis-syndication/\">Read the full story here</a></p><h2>4.
