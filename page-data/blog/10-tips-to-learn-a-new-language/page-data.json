Set a goal</h2><p>When I was studying for my Bachelor’s degree, I discovered this cool goal-setting acronym called <strong>SMAART</strong>.</p><p>The SMAART goal stands for <a href=\"https://cdn01.acu.edu/content/dam/community/documents/emp-fin/hr/setting-smaart-goals.pdf\"><i>Specific, Measurable, Aggressive yet Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound</i></a><i>.</i></p><p><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/4_2_70584e97be.jpg\" alt=\"4-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_4_2_70584e97be.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_4_2_70584e97be.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_4_2_70584e97be.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_4_2_70584e97be.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"></p><p>When goals are set with this acronym, greater outcomes can be reached since you know exactly what you want.</p><p>An example of a SMAART goal could be:</p><blockquote><p><i>I want to be able to watch Korean Drama without subtitles in six months. To reach this goal, I am going to learn 20 new phrases every day.</i></p></blockquote><p>In 6 months, you would have learnt <strong>18,000 new phrases</strong>!</p><p>Having a SMAART goal will help you achieve your goal quicker.</p><h2>3. Watch foreign shows</h2><p><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/5_2_61b2efa52b.jpg\" alt=\"5-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_5_2_61b2efa52b.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_5_2_61b2efa52b.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_5_2_61b2efa52b.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_5_2_61b2efa52b.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"></p><p><i>This tip is my favourite.</i></p><p>Sure, learning your target language’s grammar is important. However, the native speakers don’t speak as to how the textbooks teach you.</p><p>The textbook language is way too formal.</p><p>So, what’s the best way to speak a language the way the natives do? Watch foreign shows.</p><p>By watching English TV Series, I was able to learn new slangs. I learn slangs such as “<i>ditch</i>”, “<i>chill</i>”, “<i>slay</i>”, “<i>stan</i>”, “<i>spill the tea</i>” by watching TV.</p><p>It is also easier to pick up new phrases by watching foreign shows.</p><p>For example, when I was watching a Korean Drama, these phrases are constantly repeated:</p><ol><li><strong>가지마</strong>/ga-ji-ma (don’t go)<br><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/6_2_c940d37cfd.jpg\" alt=\"6-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_6_2_c940d37cfd.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_6_2_c940d37cfd.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_6_2_c940d37cfd.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_6_2_c940d37cfd.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"></li><li><strong>보고싶어</strong>/bo-go-sip-eo (I miss you)<br><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/7_2_e1670cb9dd.jpg\" alt=\"7-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_7_2_e1670cb9dd.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_7_2_e1670cb9dd.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_7_2_e1670cb9dd.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_7_2_e1670cb9dd.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"></li><li><strong>괜찮아</strong>/gwaenchanh-a (Ok or are you ok?)<br><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/8_1_fa9806cea1.jpg\" alt=\"8-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_8_1_fa9806cea1.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_8_1_fa9806cea1.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_8_1_fa9806cea1.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_8_1_fa9806cea1.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"></li><li><strong>미안해</strong>/mian-hae (I’m sorry)<br><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/9_e0219fc625.jpg\" alt=\"9.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_9_e0219fc625.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_9_e0219fc625.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_9_e0219fc625.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_9_e0219fc625.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"></li><li><strong>어떻게</strong>/eo-tteoh-ge (how?)<br><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/10_547cf2af42.jpg\" alt=\"10.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_10_547cf2af42.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_10_547cf2af42.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_10_547cf2af42.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_10_547cf2af42.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"></li></ol><p>So, now when I’m talking with my Korean friends, I will randomly insert those phrases in my sentence!</p><h2>4. Converse with others</h2><p><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/11_7042573237.jpg\" alt=\"11.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_11_7042573237.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_11_7042573237.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_11_7042573237.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_11_7042573237.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"></p><p>One of the challenges of learning a new language is not having anyone to practise with.</p><p>I could not master Mandarin when I was still in school because I had no one to practise with.</p><p>My parents do not speak Mandarin, and my classmates were just as terrible as I did.</p><p>When I started my part-time job, I had many Chinese friends. I learnt so much more new Mandarin phrases than I did for my 12-year Mandarin lessons back in school.</p><p>If you can’t find anyone to converse with, you can always find someone who is willing to on the internet. <i>You can do it from Twitter, Reddit or even by playing online games!</i></p><p>I made so many good friends on Twitter, and I have met most of them in different countries!</p><h2>5. Leave your comfort zone</h2><p><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/12_e4ed382876.jpg\" alt=\"12.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_12_e4ed382876.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_12_e4ed382876.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_12_e4ed382876.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_12_e4ed382876.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"></p><p>I know some people from school who have lived most of their lives in Indonesia but cannot converse in Bahasa Indonesia. They went to a school with English as a medium, lived in a neighbourhood full of expatriates and made friends with foreigners. They did not have a reason to learn Bahasa Indonesia.</p><p>If you really want to learn a new language, you need to leave your bubble and expand your network. Go make friends with people who speak your target language.</p><p>Another important aspect of leaving your comfort zone is to be confident in speaking your target language.</p><p>I struggled a lot to learn Mandarin because I was afraid of pronouncing the words wrong. Mandarin has different tones, and different tones have different meanings.</p><p>I was always made fun of when I pronounced the wrong words. It crushed my confidence.</p><p>When I conversed with my colleague during my part-time job, they never made fun of my ‘broken Mandarin’. They helped me pronounce the words correctly and boosted my confidence.</p><p>Leaving your comfort zone will be scary, but trust me, <strong>it is worth it</strong>!</p><h2>6. Listen to podcasts</h2><p><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/13_f6acfa3255.jpg\" alt=\"13.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_13_f6acfa3255.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_13_f6acfa3255.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_13_f6acfa3255.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_13_f6acfa3255.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"></p><p>If you do not have time to watch movies, tv-series, or videos, you can always listen to podcasts. Nowadays, there are many language programs on Spotify or Apple Podcasts.</p><p>You can download the podcasts or stream them on the way to work.</p><p>Listening to podcasts will help you familiarize yourself with the words.</p><p>You can also increase the audio speed if you think that the speakers are speaking too slow or decrease the speed if you feel that they are talking too fast.</p><h2>7. Make flashcards</h2><p><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/14_97d1846e21.jpg\" alt=\"14.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_14_97d1846e21.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_14_97d1846e21.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_14_97d1846e21.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_14_97d1846e21.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"></p><p>Flashcard is an effective tool to study.</p><p>When you learn a new language by reading a textbook, you can get overwhelmed by the number of words that you see.</p><p>Flashcards allow you to learn new words without cluttering your mind.</p><blockquote><p><i>“Flashcards give your brain a very quick way to check if you got the answer correct. They also help you engage in active recall, which teaches your brain to remember a term, concept or process without context clues. They allow you to repeat the act of learning and memorizing until you are an expert on the information,” said the </i><a href=\"https://www.petersons.com/blog/why-flashcards-work/\"><i>Marketing Director of Peterson’s</i></a><i>, Elizabeth Barry.</i></p></blockquote><h2>8.

You will most likely forget what you have learnt or lose your motivation.</p><p>Make a daily schedule that can accommodate your SMAART goal.</p><p>Practising can come in different forms, as I have said in the previous tips. <i>Here is an example…</i></p><p>If you want to learn Spanish, you can do this:</p><p><strong>Monday</strong>: watch a Spanish movie after work or school</p><p><strong>Tuesday</strong>: Have a zoom call with your online Spanish friend</p><p><strong>Wednesday</strong>: Spend your evening with people from the Spanish community</p><p><strong>Thursday</strong>: Listen to Spanish podcasts on the way to work</p><p><strong>Friday</strong>: Read a Spanish news article in the morning</p><p><strong>Saturday</strong>: Write Spanish poems before doing your chores</p><p><strong>Sunday</strong>: Read a Spanish book before going to bed</p><p>Practising every day does not have to be dull and boring. You can do different things as long as you keep on doing it regularly.</p><p>Now that you are ready to master a new language, <i>why don’t you try our tool that can help you translate video contents quickly and efficiently?</i></p><p>Here at Video Translator, we use Artificial Intelligence to translate your videos conveniently.</p><p>Find out why you should use AI-powered translators <a href=\"https://videotranslator.ai/news/why-you-should-use-ai-powered-translator/\">here</a> or contact us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@videotranslator.ai\"><i><strong>hello@videotranslator.ai</strong></i></a> for more information.</p>"}},"postedDate":"Apr 04, 2021"},"relatedBlogPost":{"nodes":[{"id":"e57e4aab-ba13-5d6f-87d6-e44e825e5814","title":"How to Add Subtitles to YouTube Videos","slug":"how-to-add-subtitles-to-youtube-videos","description":"Learn how to easily add subtitles to your YouTube videos to enhance accessibility and reach a wider audience.","cover":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5180b5441d2711cb6b8a0da16e0cb994/669f3/How_to_add_subtitles_to_You_Tube_093c35874f.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5180b5441d2711cb6b8a0da16e0cb994/53b2b/How_to_add_subtitles_to_You_Tube_093c35874f.jpg 256w,\n/static/5180b5441d2711cb6b8a0da16e0cb994/d4d2a/How_to_add_subtitles_to_You_Tube_093c35874f.jpg 512w,\n/static/5180b5441d2711cb6b8a0da16e0cb994/669f3/How_to_add_subtitles_to_You_Tube_093c35874f.jpg 1024w","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5180b5441d2711cb6b8a0da16e0cb994/36766/How_to_add_subtitles_to_You_Tube_093c35874f.webp 256w,\n/static/5180b5441d2711cb6b8a0da16e0cb994/a79fe/How_to_add_subtitles_to_You_Tube_093c35874f.webp 512w,\n/static/5180b5441d2711cb6b8a0da16e0cb994/2d898/How_to_add_subtitles_to_You_Tube_093c35874f.webp 1024w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"}]},"width":1024,"height":768}}}},"coverAlt":"How to Add Subtitles to YouTube Videos","postedDate":"Aug 12, 2024","blogCategories":[{"categoryName":"Subtitles"},{"categoryName":"Video Transcription"},{"categoryName":"Captions"},{"categoryName":"Translation"},{"categoryName":"Video Translation"}]},{"id":"311bfb51-428e-5c7a-8000-a29909fe95e2","title":"Top 5 Translation Tools for Professionals and Learners","slug":"top-5-translation-tools-for-professionals-and-learners","description":"Discover the top 5 translation tools to enhance your professional and learning experiences.
