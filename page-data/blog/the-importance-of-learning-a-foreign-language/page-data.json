Growing up here, you would think that my mother tongue would be Bahasa Indonesia. However, my first language is a dialect from the South Sumatera province called Palembang.</p><p><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/3_2_4cb9cb8edf.jpg\" alt=\"3-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_3_2_4cb9cb8edf.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_3_2_4cb9cb8edf.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_3_2_4cb9cb8edf.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_3_2_4cb9cb8edf.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"></p><blockquote><p><i>According to </i><a href=\"https://asian.washington.edu/fields/indonesian#:~:text=Over%20300%20different%20native%20languages,people%20as%20their%20second%20language.\"><i>Asian Languages and Literature from the University of Washington</i></a><i>, “<strong>While Bahasa Indonesia is spoken as a mother tongue by only 7% of the total population, it is the national language and is used by 200 million people as their second language</strong>.”</i></p></blockquote><p>If my mother tongue were not my local dialect, I would have struggled to communicate with my relatives. The locals take pride in speaking their local dialects.</p><p><i><strong>Fun fact, if you travel to Indonesia, you will most probably get a discount if you can speak in their local dialect.</strong></i></p><p>Although our local dialect is our mother tongue, most Indonesians can speak Bahasa Indonesia as it is our official language.</p><p>Bahasa Indonesia is commonly used for business and administrative purposes as well as by education institutions and mass media throughout the country to facilitate communication among the Indonesians.</p><p>My mind began to wander to the times when my family would travel to different provinces. We would visit some local shops to buy some souvenirs. Although the staffs would generally speak in a local dialect, they would immediately switch to Bahasa Indonesia when they talk to customers.</p><p><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/4_1_c63ce71235.jpg\" alt=\"4-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_4_1_c63ce71235.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_4_1_c63ce71235.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_4_1_c63ce71235.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_4_1_c63ce71235.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"></p><p>If I hadn’t been able to speak Bahasa Indonesia, I would be stuck in my tiny little bubble in South Sumatera and struggle to communicate with everyone else across the country.</p><h2>Learning a foreign language will help you see the world</h2><p>When I was in primary school, my parents sent me to study in a school that uses English as the medium of instruction. I struggled a lot in the beginning as none of my parents speaks English.</p><p><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/5_1_069363200b.jpg\" alt=\"5-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_5_1_069363200b.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_5_1_069363200b.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_5_1_069363200b.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_5_1_069363200b.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"></p><p>As a kid, I was timid to speak English in front of anyone.

That day, I wanted to share an online article with my parents. Since they do not speak English, I needed to find the translated version.

By learning English, I was able to gain so much more information about everything I want to know.</p><h2>Learning a foreign language deepen your connection to other cultures</h2><p>If there were one language that I regret not learning, it would be Mandarin. As an Indonesian with a Chinese background, my parents wanted me to know Mandarin.

I would be sent to after-school Mandarin class and hated every bit of it. I was not good at it. I felt embarrassed when I speak the language because my friends would laugh at me.</p><p>Truth be told, I was proud to say to people that I was terrible in Mandarin. <strong>I boasted of my inability to speak a foreign language.</strong></p><p>Looking back, <i>I feel so silly</i>. I wish I hadn’t done what I did.</p><p>When I moved to Australia, I had a part-time job in a café where I worked with many Chinese people. That’s the moment that I realized that I should have taken my Mandarin classes seriously.</p><p>As a 21-year-old third-generation Chinese Indonesian, I know nothing about my history. I did not know even know the name of my great grandparents. Even if I did, I won’t be able to read their names because they would be written in Mandarin.
