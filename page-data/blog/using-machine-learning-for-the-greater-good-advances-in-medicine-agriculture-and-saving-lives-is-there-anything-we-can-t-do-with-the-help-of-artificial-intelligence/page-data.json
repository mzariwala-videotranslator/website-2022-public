For the sake of safety: This AI sensor triggers an alarm when kids are left alone in a car</h2><p>Too many times we hear the heartbreaking stories of children and animals dying after getting left in cars on hot summer days. Luckily scientists at the University of Waterloo, Canada have developed a low-cost AI sensor that may very well save lives.<br>The small device will be able to detect movement from breathing and will sound an alarm (and potentially disable the ability to lock the car), if it detects a living being is still in a vehicle.</p><p>““It addresses a serious, world-wide problem. The system is so affordable it could become standard equipment in all vehicles,” George Shaker, an engineering professor at Waterloo said in a statement.”</p><p>Hoping to be on the market by the end of next year, we look forward to this advancement in technology.</p><p><a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/for-the-sake-of-safety-this-ai-sensor-triggers-an-alarm-when-kids-are-left-alone-in-a-car/articleshow/72004514.cms\">Read more here</a></p><h2>3.

Burton/Getty Images\"></p><p>We really couldn’t have summed up this article better ourselves, so we’ll let authors Sema Sgaier and Francesca Dominici do it for us:</p><p>“Health care leaders are embracing AI. But by conducting an extensive review of case studies and research literature, we’ve found that their AI initiatives are predominantly focused on developing algorithms that can predict a problem such as cancer in order to make diagnoses better, faster, and less expensively. Rarely, are their organizations devoting resources to AI efforts aimed at understanding why diseases occur. To intervene as effectively as possible, both kinds of algorithms are crucial.”</p><p>The article goes in depth of explaining what is being done to use AI at discovering the causes of disease as well as just predicting them.</p><p><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/11/using-ai-to-understand-what-causes-diseases\">Read more here</a></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>This week has shown great developments in technology, especially in the AI field where we are seeing just how beneficial AI technology is becoming for us around the world.</p><p>Please connect with us on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/videotranslator/\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGrwmRcZiFkyq8-xAwn77Yg/\">YouTube</a> or <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/videotranslatorai/\">Facebook</a> for any comments, questions, or just to keep up to date with the work we do!</p><p>We are very grateful for your support!</p><p>If you haven’t yet and are interested in trying out our technology, please <a href=\"https://videotranslator.ai/free-trial\">try our platform</a>, or drop us an email at <a href=\"mailto:hello@videotranslator.ai\">hello@videotranslator.ai</a>.</p>"}},"postedDate":"Nov 10, 2019"},"relatedBlogPost":{"nodes":[{"id":"6e1f887d-b3da-5bb3-9a2b-d5dd54134997","title":"VideoTranslatorAI at the 2024 NSW Commercialisation Showcase","slug":"videotranslatorai-at-the-2024-nsw-commercialisation-showcase","description":"Join VideoTranslatorAI as we showcase cutting-edge tech at the 2024 NSW Commercialisation Showcase, celebrating innovation and collaboration in NSW!","cover":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#383828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/2a97a192100931aee68db925ca6c1f90/669f3/Video_Translator_AI_at_the_2024_NSW_Commercialisation_Showcase_a8dadcf777.jpg","srcSet":"/static/2a97a192100931aee68db925ca6c1f90/53b2b/Video_Translator_AI_at_the_2024_NSW_Commercialisation_Showcase_a8dadcf777.jpg 256w,\n/static/2a97a192100931aee68db925ca6c1f90/d4d2a/Video_Translator_AI_at_the_2024_NSW_Commercialisation_Showcase_a8dadcf777.jpg 512w,\n/static/2a97a192100931aee68db925ca6c1f90/669f3/Video_Translator_AI_at_the_2024_NSW_Commercialisation_Showcase_a8dadcf777.jpg 1024w","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/2a97a192100931aee68db925ca6c1f90/36766/Video_Translator_AI_at_the_2024_NSW_Commercialisation_Showcase_a8dadcf777.webp 256w,\n/static/2a97a192100931aee68db925ca6c1f90/a79fe/Video_Translator_AI_at_the_2024_NSW_Commercialisation_Showcase_a8dadcf777.webp 512w,\n/static/2a97a192100931aee68db925ca6c1f90/2d898/Video_Translator_AI_at_the_2024_NSW_Commercialisation_Showcase_a8dadcf777.webp 1024w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"}]},"width":1024,"height":768}}}},"coverAlt":"VideoTranslatorAI at the 2024 NSW Commercialisation Showcase","postedDate":"Apr 21, 2024","blogCategories":[{"categoryName":"Enterprise"},{"categoryName":"Healthcare"},{"categoryName":"Safety"}]},{"id":"b20e7c3f-49cd-55a1-a294-e6e0b3aa5a2f","title":"VideoTranslatorAI Wins Feasibility Study for NSW Small Business Innovation & Research Program","slug":"VideoTranslatorAI-wins-feasibility-study-for-nsw-small-business-innovation-research-program","description":"VideoTranslatorAI wins NSW SBIR 2022 feasibility study, focusing on AI for healthcare in CALD communities.
