The project proposes a custom AI solution that enables real-time translation of emergency broadcasts into over 20 languages. By bridging the language gap, Trusted Lingo aims to enhance the safety and understanding of CALD populations, ensuring inclusive and effective communication during crisis situations.</p><p>Effective communication is crucial during emergencies to protect lives and property. However, breakdowns in communication can lead to incomplete evacuations, trapped individuals, and even fatalities. Research shows that people with language barriers are slower to process messages not in their native language, making them particularly vulnerable during crises. In Australia, with approximately 7 million people speaking a language other than English at home, a significant portion of the population is at risk of failing to understand crucial instructions during natural hazards.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2_862ee41aae.jpg\" alt=\"Trusted Lingo designates language specific 'local information champions' i.e. community leaders as the focal point of effective communications.\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_2_862ee41aae.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_2_862ee41aae.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_2_862ee41aae.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_2_862ee41aae.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"><figcaption>Trusted Lingo's focal point is the effective communication to 'local information champions', i.e., community leaders to effectively get emergency services messaging out.</figcaption></figure><p>Trusted Lingo aims to address this problem by providing a reliable solution that transcends language barriers. The project is a collaborative effort between VideoTranslator, Macquarie University, and the University of Newcastle. The proposed AI solution will offer real-time translation of audio, video, and text emergency broadcasts into multiple languages. It will utilize notification services to disseminate the translated content through different social media networks, targeting specific CALD communities.</p><p>The project's approach includes designating \"local information champions\" within the CALD communities, such as community organizations and social media groups. These champions will receive fully translated audio, video, and text communications minutes after emergency broadcasts occur, ensuring timely and accurate information reaches those who need it most. By involving local language-specific organizations, Trusted Lingo aims to enhance the effectiveness of emergency services' communication efforts.</p><p>To ensure the accuracy and reliability of translations, Trusted Lingo will develop glossaries of emergency services terminology, geographical names, and accurate translations. These glossaries will be used to test transcription and translation accuracy of emergency broadcasts, creating a library of reference material to train the AI continuously. The project also emphasizes the need to frame issues and solutions in a culturally appropriate way, understanding the differences between spoken and written languages.</p><p>In addition to translation capabilities, Trusted Lingo recognizes the importance of assessing the efficacy and engagement of end-users within CALD communities. The University of Newcastle's Lab for Applied Language Science will conduct research to evaluate the level of attention, comprehension, and digital trust among users of the proposed system. This assessment will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different communication methods, such as audio versus text, and guide future improvements.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/4_9dcf45178b.jpg\" alt=\"4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_4_9dcf45178b.jpg 208w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/small_4_9dcf45178b.jpg 500w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/medium_4_9dcf45178b.jpg 750w,https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/large_4_9dcf45178b.jpg 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1000px\"><figcaption>In development, what Trusted Lingo's interface will look like for triggering SMS notifications at scale.</figcaption></figure><p>The success of Trusted Lingo relies on collaboration with emergency services and stakeholders in the field. The project invites expressions of interest from crisis communications practitioners, community engagement service members, and individuals engaged in coordination tasks during natural hazards. By involving these stakeholders, the project aims to ensure that the solution meets the rigorous requirements of emergency services and is tailored to their specific needs.</p><p>Trusted Lingo envisions a simple web application deployed at crisis communications centre's, enabling easy upload of audio or video files for automatic transcription and translation. The solution will generate multiple files with translated captions and the option for voiceovers, catering to different language needs. These language-specific videos will be automatically shared with pre-identified local information champions via social media channels, allowing for quick and widespread dissemination of critical information.</p><p>In conclusion, Trusted Lingo strives to create an accurate, cost-effective, and inclusive emergency communication system for today's diverse society. By leveraging AI technology and collaboration, it aims to break language barriers, ensure the safety of CALD populations, and improve overall emergency response and preparedness.</p><p>File Download: <a href=\"https://vt-website-prod.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/APF_84_Banerjee_v2_a5f0d42394.pdf\">APF84_Banerjee_v2.pdf</a></p>"}},"postedDate":"Nov 19, 2022"},"relatedBlogPost":{"nodes":[{"id":"6e1f887d-b3da-5bb3-9a2b-d5dd54134997","title":"VideoTranslatorAI at the 2024 NSW Commercialisation Showcase","slug":"videotranslatorai-at-the-2024-nsw-commercialisation-showcase","description":"Join VideoTranslatorAI as we showcase cutting-edge tech at the 2024 NSW Commercialisation Showcase, celebrating innovation and collaboration in NSW!","cover":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#383828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/2a97a192100931aee68db925ca6c1f90/669f3/Video_Translator_AI_at_the_2024_NSW_Commercialisation_Showcase_a8dadcf777.jpg","srcSet":"/static/2a97a192100931aee68db925ca6c1f90/53b2b/Video_Translator_AI_at_the_2024_NSW_Commercialisation_Showcase_a8dadcf777.jpg 256w,\n/static/2a97a192100931aee68db925ca6c1f90/d4d2a/Video_Translator_AI_at_the_2024_NSW_Commercialisation_Showcase_a8dadcf777.jpg 512w,\n/static/2a97a192100931aee68db925ca6c1f90/669f3/Video_Translator_AI_at_the_2024_NSW_Commercialisation_Showcase_a8dadcf777.jpg 1024w","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/2a97a192100931aee68db925ca6c1f90/36766/Video_Translator_AI_at_the_2024_NSW_Commercialisation_Showcase_a8dadcf777.webp 256w,\n/static/2a97a192100931aee68db925ca6c1f90/a79fe/Video_Translator_AI_at_the_2024_NSW_Commercialisation_Showcase_a8dadcf777.webp 512w,\n/static/2a97a192100931aee68db925ca6c1f90/2d898/Video_Translator_AI_at_the_2024_NSW_Commercialisation_Showcase_a8dadcf777.webp 1024w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"}]},"width":1024,"height":768}}}},"coverAlt":"VideoTranslatorAI at the 2024 NSW Commercialisation Showcase","postedDate":"Apr 21, 2024","blogCategories":[{"categoryName":"Enterprise"},{"categoryName":"Healthcare"},{"categoryName":"Safety"}]},{"id":"ae5dcc7f-64d6-54bd-bb27-c6ff8043b421","title":"Our Trusted Lingo Poster Was Accepted At AFAC '23!","slug":"our-trusted-lingo-poster-was-accepted-at-afac-23","description":"Our poster on Project Trusted Lingo was accepted at the AFAC Conference.
