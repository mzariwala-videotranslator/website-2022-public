This week we had a few stories come by which show much progress is being made in the popularity of regional languages.</p><p>Here at <a href=\"https://videotranslator.ai/free-trial\">VideoTranslator</a> we feel that most people are quite proud of where they come from - its totally natural.</p><p>Each one of us has a story of how we came to be, and the stories of those who came before are a vital part of any human identity. This week we have two such stories.</p><p>We are also experimenting with more video, so here is a sample! Let us know what you think!</p><figure class=\"media\"><oembed url=\"https://youtu.be/Pc5XA5kdNmc\"></oembed></figure><h2>One Igbo Woman Trying To Save Her language</h2><p>This <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/01/onyinye-ibelegbu-her-battle-to-save-mother-tongue/\">article from the Nigerian Vanguard newspaper</a> covers one such story.</p><p>Onyinye Ibelegbu, the CEO of the NwaadaIgbo Language School is working to save indigenous Nigerian languages from extinction.</p><p><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/site-assets-prod/blog_assets/one-igbo-woman-trying-to-save-her-language/one-igbo-woman-trying-to-save-her-language_1.jpg\"></p><p>The model was first pioneered by her in her mother tongue Igbo. “…At the time I left ZINOX, I had signed up on international teaching platforms. I also signed up on Tuterial as an Igbo Language teacher. I notice, however, that the demand for Igbo Language teaching was very high.”</p><p>Nice! This paragraph is illuminating however, I remember that we got punished as students for speaking our mother tongue which was tagged ‘vernacular’ at school. That affected the growth of our indigenous languages greatly. I however think it starts from the home. Yes, our national language is English, but that doesn’t mean we won’t grow our indigenous languages.</p><p>“… The Hausa Language is faring better. The average Hausa person will ask you why you cannot speak Hausa and will tell you that you’re supposed to speak her language since you are on her land. I learned the language while working there because they are a people who either do not care to speak English or who don’t know how to. And no matter how wealthy a Hausa man is, Hausa Language is always the language of communication in his home.”</p><p>This is true - within the <a href=\"https://videotranslator.ai/free-trial\">VideoTranslator</a> we have Hausa, but we do not have Igbo.
