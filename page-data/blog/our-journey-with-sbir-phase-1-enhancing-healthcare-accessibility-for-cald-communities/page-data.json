Research (SBIR) program, specifically the Cultural and Linguistic Diversity Challenge presented by NSW Health / SWSLHD, began.</p><p>Last year, we received the exhilarating news that our proposal had clinched <a href=\"https://videotranslator.ai/blog/VideoTranslatorAI-wins-feasibility-study-for-nsw-small-business-innovation-research-program/\">SBIR Phase 1</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This marked the inception of a collaborative effort between VideoTranslatorAI and the University of Newcastle, aimed at leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to revolutionize healthcare accessibility for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) communities.</p><h3>Our Team</h3><p>Our team, comprising individuals driven by a shared passion for innovation and inclusivity, embodies the synergy between academia and industry.&nbsp;</p><p>At the helm is Professor Kiwako Ito, leading a group of dedicated researchers including PhD students Suzan Makhloof, Mais Alsabayleh, and Ashraf Abdelbaky, as well as undergraduate students Elizabeth Walker, Madeleine Lock, and Tessa Robertson.&nbsp;</p><p>On the industry side, VideoTranslatorAI brings forth the expertise of Tat Banerjee, Tessa Joana, James Wilson, and Nic Mantzivis.</p><p>We would like to acknowledge Ayu Saraswati, Catherine Oates-Smith, and Nick Haskins from NSSN for acting as our academic liaison team.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, we would like to thank the UoN commercialisation team, including Maree Campbell and Monique Moore.&nbsp;</p><h3>What we did during the feasibility study</h3><p>Phase 1 of our project focuses on conducting a feasibility study centred around voice-to-text transcription, translation, and analysis software.</p><p>In practise, we were looking for ways in which audit, reporting and remediation processes can be put in place to ensure the AI works correctly during complex medical conversations.</p><p>The maternity and midwifery team at SWSLHD uses a specific lexicon when communicating with patients, and the Interpreter Services team has specific translations when the patients are from CALD backgrounds.&nbsp;</p><p>How to use an AI to do this at scale, while providing the tools to ensure accuracy, but also meet regulatory and ethical standards, was the core question of the feasibility study.</p><p>Our overarching goal is to facilitate seamless communication during antenatal visits, thereby enhancing the overall patient experience for multicultural communities.</p><p>This endeavour perfectly aligns with VideoTranslatorAI's mission to harness AI's potential in overcoming linguistic barriers and fostering effective communication across diverse settings.&nbsp;</p><p>As we delve into this feasibility study, we're not only exploring technological solutions but also delving into the intricacies of cultural sensitivity and healthcare delivery.</p><h3>What happens next?</h3><p>Post SBIR phase 1, the University of Newcastle's team is currently in the process of compiling a report detailing the AI's performance and the challenges encountered during the feasibility studies.</p><p>This report not only serves as a testament to our dedication but also provides valuable insights that can shape future endeavours in healthcare innovation. Their dedication and expertise were instrumental in navigating the complexities of the project.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>In conclusion, our journey with SBIR Phase 1 has been nothing short of transformative. It has reinforced our belief in the power of collaboration, innovation, and technology to create meaningful change.&nbsp;</p><p>As we reflect on our journey, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to Southwest Sydney Local Health District (SWSLHD), the Office of the NSW Chief Scientist &amp; Engineer, and the Small Business Innovation &amp; Research program team for their unwavering support and belief in our vision.</p><p>Their encouragement fuelled our determination to push boundaries and drive innovation.</p><p>Looking ahead, we hopefully anticipate the next phase of our journey – SBIR Phase 2. With a solid foundation laid in Phase 1 and the invaluable insights gained, we are poised to take our innovation to new heights.</p><p>Together with our partners at the University of Newcastle, we remain steadfast in our commitment to revolutionizing healthcare communication for CALD communities!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"}},"postedDate":"Apr 03, 2024"},"relatedBlogPost":{"nodes":[{"id":"5cbd44d7-c26d-5cfb-9f62-5cf159880f94","title":"Unveiling the TikTok Trends of 2024: From GRWM to AI Innovations","slug":"unveiling-the-tiktok-trends-of-2024-from-grwm-to-ai-innovations","description":"As 2024 wraps up, don't miss these top TikTok trends!
