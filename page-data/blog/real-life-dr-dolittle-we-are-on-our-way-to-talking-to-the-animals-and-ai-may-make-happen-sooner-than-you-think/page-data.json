(Although hearing dogs constantly asking to have a ball thrown might get a bit old after a while).

That, we perhaps can all agree, is a better – and perhaps nearer-term – ideal to reach than brain-computer communications. The beauty of communicating with them will then be joined to the market ideal of talking to our pet dogs.

Pocketalk Announces 2020 Model Of Two-Way Translation Device, Marking Official U.S. Launch</h2><p>One of the leaders in translating devices, Pocketalk, has released it’s latest model with some big updates and changes. Pocketalk founder and CEO, Noriyuki explains, “Our goal with the newest Pocketalk was to take into account the many different ways people communicate. We don’t just use voice - we use visuals, we use currencies - all of these connect us closer together and with our newest model, we are providing the most dependable, thoughtful, all-encompassing device to form deeper connections without language as a barrier”</p><p>The new model is available for pre-order now and features new updates such as:</p><ul><li>Camera: instantly recognises and translates text, the written word and signs, because language shouldn’t be limited to just verbal communication</li><li>Faster: increased software processing speed for more immediate translations</li><li>Conversion: computes exchanges for currency, length, width and temperature</li><li>One-button translation: for simple translations in fewer steps</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/\">Read more here</a></p><h2>3.

Written by Rachel Nolan, this piece delves into the lack of translation services provided for Indigenous Mayan-Guatemalans who speak indigenous languages - not Spanish and the tragedies that are taking place for people seeking asylum because they don’t have a representative who can translate for them.</p><p>Nolan speaks with interpreter Oswaldo Martín, a native Mam speaker, who is drastically helping the lives of refugess who would otherwise be deported simply because they can’t speak English or Spanish and thus can’t tell their reasoning for needing refugee status.</p><p>As Nolan states, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/01/06/a-translation-crisis-at-the-border\">“Guatemala has a population of fifteen million people, forty per cent of them indigenous, according to the most recent census. In the past year, two hundred and fifty thousand Guatemalan migrants have been apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border. At least half of them are Mayans, and many speak little or no Spanish. According to the Department of Justice, Mam was the ninth most common language used in immigration courts last year, more common than French. Three Guatemalan Mayan languages made the top twenty-five: Mam, K’iche’, and Q’anjob’al.”</a></p><p>The need for translators in less common spoken languages is still extremely necessary and this article really demonstrates why.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/01/06/a-translation-crisis-at-the-border\">Read more here</a></p><h2>4. Learning a new language is like an illicit love affair</h2><p>Learning a new language can often be a love/hate relationship, we’re excited to get started, only to become frustrated when the language we long to speak is harder to master than we thought.</p><p>For those of us who are really determined, we stick to it and eventually it sticks! We are in no way near being fluent, but the language becomes easier to understand and the love affair truly begins.</p><p>This article describes the ups and downs of learning new languages and how it has helped many authors and writers in becoming the renowned wordsmiths we know them to be.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/12/13/12-everyday-applications-of-artificial-intelligence-many-people-arent-aware-of/#2df08ae148fa\">Read more here</a></p><h2>5.
