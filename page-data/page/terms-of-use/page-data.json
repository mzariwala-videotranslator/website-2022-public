This is very important because the quality of the TCV is affected by the complexity of the underlying content contained in the CV. If the underlying content in your CV is complex, then the Third Party Tools may struggle to provide a good outcome in the TCV. The use of, and reliance upon a TCV is entirely at the discretion and risk of the Client.</p><h3>SECTION 13: INDEMNITY BY CLIENT</h3><p>13.1 Client agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Video Translator and its officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors and suppliers from and against all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable solicitor’s fees, resulting from:</p><ul><li>violation of this Agreement or a warranty given by Client or any activity conducted on Client’s Account by Client or by a User accessing the Platform using Client’s Account;</li><li>a claim made against Video Translator by a third party (including, without imitation a customer of Client or an operator of Third Party Tools) alleging that Video Translator’s access to Client Video is not authorised;</li><li>a claim made against Video Translator arising from Client’s failure to comply with relevant and applicable legislation (including applicable data protection laws) when Client uses the Platform and the Services and the TCV;</li><li>a claim made against Video Translator by a third party (including, without imitation a customer of Client or an operator of Third Party Tools) alleging that a TCV contains incorrect, false or misleading information or is malicious, defamatory or offensive in its content.</li></ul><h3>SECTION 14: LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3><p>14.1 Terms, conditions, warranties and guarantees implied by law, which cannot be excluded, restricted or modified apply to this Agreement to the extent required by that law.</p><p>14.2 Except for liability in relation to any non-excludable Term, the Platform, the Services and the TCV are provided on an “as is” basis, and without any warranty or condition, express or implied, including any implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement of third party Intellectual Property Rights to the extent allowed by law.</p><p>14.3 To the extent permitted by law, Video Translator’s sole liability for breach of contract, breach of statutory duty, negligence or other tort is limited, at its option, to:</p><ul><li>the supplying of the Services again; or</li><li>the payment of the cost of having the Services supplied again.</li></ul><p>14.4 The Client does not rely on any representation, warranty or other provision made by Video Translator or on its behalf which is not expressly stated in these terms.</p><p>14.5 Video Translator is not liable for loss or corruption of a Client Video, loss of revenue, loss of goodwill loss of anticipated sales, loss of savings, loss of business opportunity, interruption to business, or wasted management/administrative time.
